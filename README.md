# Bouncy Balls
Who doesn't like to watch super colorful balls bounce around randomly and change colors as they go?
This is my first foray into javascript animation - really crude brute force style.
Enjoy checking out my newbie not-so-DRY code. :)

## How to Run
Clone this repo locally and drag and drop the index.html file into the address bar of your browser. 
Hit enter and you should be inundated with beautiful, colorful, fanciful, bouncy balls all around your screen.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Definitely need to DRY up the code. Similar to the pacmen exercise, create functionality that can create 
different types of balls and allow the user to select the type, color, size, etc.
